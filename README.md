## How to run model?
1. Download/Clone the code repository
2. Download pre-trained weights <a href="https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?export=download&confirm=I5y5&id=1n1sPXvT34yXFLT47QZA6FIRGrwMeSsZc">here</a>
3. Create a folder named weights and extract content of downloaded folder there.
4. Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the command `python main.py --source samples/test_sample.wav --target samples/trump10.wav`.
Source is the file to be converted, and target is the sample target voice.
